A script to automate updating Stardew Valley mods.

### Usage
Place script file (`sdv_modming.py`) inside of a directory containing only the new, zipped mod updates before executing.

That directory's name should start with a "**.**" and be placed inside of the Mods directory. For example: `Stardew Valley\Mods\.update`.
