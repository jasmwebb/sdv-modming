A script to automate updating Stardew Valley mods.

### Usage
Place script file (`sdv_modming.py`) inside of a directory containing only the new, zipped mod updates before executing. The script can also install new mods that don't already exist inside of the Mods folder.

That directory's name should start with a "**.**" and be placed inside of the Mods directory. For example: `Stardew Valley\Mods\.update`.
