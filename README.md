A script to automate updating Stardew Valley mods.

### Usage
Place script file (`sdv_modming.py`) inside of a directory containing only the new, zipped mods before executing.

That directory's name should start with a "**.**" and be placed inside of the Mods directory. For example: `Stardew Valley/Mods/.update`.

The script can also install new mods that don't already exist inside of the Mods folder, so long as they are zipped and inside the same directory.
